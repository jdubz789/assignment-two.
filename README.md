I started this project by getting my information on the page using sections in the html, i then moved over to css to play around with the font sizes and colours of the header/nav & sections keeping a blue & black theme with white shadow effect, and changing the read more buttons to highlight blue once hovered over also adding a pointer cursor. 

After placing my images on the page, i looked into how i could add a sliding effect to each section to make the page more appealing. I found using keyframes and adding an animation element to the .content class while adjusting the timing to create a slow back & forth motion worked well for this. 

After playing around with margins & image sizes and adding opacity behind text, i added a link to my instagram account above the copyright footer, and finally opened an audio folder placed an mp3 file within & copied the file path in the html using an audio tag to add background music that plays automatically.

Reflextion
I enjoyed this project, especially learning how to incorporate music in a website and creating animations. if i was to improve on it i would have added a back to top button for a better user experience but still unsure on how to tackle this using java. Any feedback appreciated
